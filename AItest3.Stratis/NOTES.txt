With the introduction of the functions file and the while loop for the FPS_AVG the cps has increased too much
this is now a bad benchmark we need to remove that while loop and remove the functions file and keep this as simple as posible.

when i run the test now the cps is far too high compared to the previous version.


No while loops when the mission is creating at all !!!!
