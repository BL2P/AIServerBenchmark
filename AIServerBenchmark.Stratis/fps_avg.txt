fps_avg.fsm by Fred41

This FSM allows FPS smoothing and precise approximation to a target FPS for benchmarking purposes.

fps_avg.fsm samples diag_fps values each 320ms, what means each 16 frames at 50 FPS.
Because diag_fps returns the average of the last 16 frames, allmost all frames are included in averaging, this way.

Additional, this FSM calculates a delay based on the distance of current- and targetvalue and a base delay.
This allows slowing down load simulation (unit creation), dependend of distance to target FPS value (FPSLIMIT).

Usage: [number of samples, max. FPS, FPSLIMIT, BASEDELAY] execFSM "fps_avg.fsm"
Wait: waituntil {sleep 0.1; !isNil("fps_avg")};
GlobVars: fps_avg, delay_adapt
Example:
	
	[64,50.0,45,10] execFSM "fps_avg.fsm";
	waituntil {sleep 0.1; !isNil("fps_avg")};
	
	now fetch global var 'fps_avg' instead of 'diag_fps'
	and get the delay in global var 'delay_adapt'
	
Happy benchmarking :)
